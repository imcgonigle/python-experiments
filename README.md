# Python Experiments
This repo contains small Python programs I've written to learn more about Python and different Python libraries

## Experiments
- fetch-links.py - Scrapes a webpage for links and prints them in a table.
- gui-scrape-link.py - A GUI program that lets you enter a URL for it to scrape and display all of the links it finds.
