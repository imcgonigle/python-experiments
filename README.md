# Python Experiments
This repo contains small Python programs I've written to learn more about Python and different Python libraries

## Getting Started
I use pipenv and pyenv to run the experiments in this repo.

### Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/imcgonigle/python-experiments.git`

### Create a virtual environment
`pipenv shell`

### Install the dependencies
`pipenv install`

### Run one of the experiments
`pipenv run python experiments/{EXPERIMENT_NAME}`

## Experiments
- fetch-links.py - Scrapes a webpage for links and prints them in a table.
- gui-scrape-link.py - A GUI program that lets you enter a URL for it to scrape and display all of the links it finds.
